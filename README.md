## Improvements

If I had more time to work on this project, I would improve the follow items:

1 - Create a Launch Screen

2 - Research for better images for the horoscope list and detailed modal

3 - Include a loading icon for the images when it does requests

4 - Improve the list Header and Section

5 - Play with Colors, paddings and spacings
